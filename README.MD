# BookStore Database Project

This is my simple BookStore database project. It uses Python to connect to a PostgreSQL database. I built it to practice my skills with databases and Python. The project includes functions to add authors, books, customers, and orders into the database.

## Features

- Add new authors and books to the database
- Add new customers
- Create orders and order details for customers
- Update book quantities when orders are made

## Requirements

You need to install these Python libraries to run the project. You can find them in the `requirements.txt` file.

- `psycopg2` (for connecting to PostgreSQL)
- `python-dotenv` (for loading environment variables from a `.env` file)
- Optional: `flake8` and `black` for linting and formatting the code.
